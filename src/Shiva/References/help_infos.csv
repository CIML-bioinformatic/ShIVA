Feature variance is then calculated on the standardized values after clipping to a maximum. This method allows you to choose the number of genes to select.<BR><BR><b>mean.var.plot</b>: First, uses a function to calculate average expression (mean.function) and dispersion (dispersion.function) for each feature. Next, divides features into num.bin (default 20) bins based on their average expression, and calculates z-scores for dispersion within each bin.
